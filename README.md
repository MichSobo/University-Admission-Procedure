# University-Admission-Procedure

## Description
The program will help the university to choose the best candidates for enrolling.

The candidates may apply to different departments (Mathematics, Physics, Biotech, Chemistry, Engineering), selecting
different priorities at the same time.
The candidates are assessed based on their exams scores.
Departments take various exam results for candidates evaluation - department selection determines the results that will
be taken into consideration.

The program selects maximum `n` best candidates for all departments and saves the result to text files for each department.

## Usage
User inputs an integer that represents the maximum number of candidates allowed to be admitted to every department.
The path to the applicants' data file is hard-coded, and is stored in _applicants.txt_ file by default.
Eventually, the program saves admitted applicants to text files, each for every department.
